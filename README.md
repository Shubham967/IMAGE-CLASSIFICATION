# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION USING SVM
Image classification is a multiclass classification. We have four classes names as dog(1), cat(0), horse(3), human being(3). Our SVM is binary classifier which means it only classify between 2 classes. It can predict only the negative and the positive class. So we will extend our SVM classifier to a multiclass classifier and will do the predictions.
